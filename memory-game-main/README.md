Memory Game is a fun game that lets you test your memory of where cards have been
randomly laid out. You may know it as Concentration, or any of a number of other
names. I hope you enjoy it!

# Quickstart
The quickest way to get started is to make sure all of the files are in the same
directory and open index.html in a browser. If you've arranged your files correctly
this should have no issues.

## Dependencies
Memory Game runs with jQuery and Font Awesome.

## Format of the game
1 Click a card to reveal its symbol
2 Try to reveal a second card with the same symbol
3 Repeat until all cards are matched
4 Try to do it in as few moves as possible! 15 or fewer for full marks!

# More Information
Matching cards can be a low-investment way to engage your brain for a minute or two
if you need to clear your head, or just stay active in some downtime.
